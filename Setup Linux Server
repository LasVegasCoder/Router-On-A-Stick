/**
  Router on a stick setup using Linux server 64bit, 32bit server will not work.

  What we're going to accomplish with this setup are:
  * Ability to have Web Servers on a distributed network
  * Create Database servers on a distributed network
  * Setup a Media Server for live broadcast
  * Setup a Mail Server
  * Setup a Window 8/10 on the network
  * Setup File Servers Master & Slave
  * Setup Phone Server
  * Setup Dev Server
  * Hardening security
  * and more.

  Imagine if you could carry all of the above in a flash drive? Let's say you could plug your flash into any computer boot and have access to virtual
  resources that was created by you, e.g Windows 8/10, Web Servers, Mail Servers and other VPS.
